#Introduction to SQL & Databases

Slides and materials are hosted at [http://example.com/](http://example.com/).

## Course description

Use this space for a short description of your course. We recommend using the description from your meetup event.

We generate data with everything we do.  Websites, phones, and computers track our preferences and history.  Stores track our shopping and payment patterns.  Schools and employers track our progress and completion.  Data are all around us.  We all are generating data every day.

In addition, most of us are consuming data by searching the internet, requesting reports, and checking to see how many 'repins' and 'retweets' we have gotten that day.  We want to know what is trending, or popular.  We get recommendations for entertainment options on Netflix or Amazon or Pandora.

All of this is made possible through the storage and manipulation of data.  Because companies and websites can track our history, and can review that data, they can make targeted recommendations for us.  Because websites like Amazon can store and retrieve our data, we don't have to re-enter our address every time we make an order.  Databases even make it possible for you to download a book to a new tablet and keep all of your bookmarks and notes from a previous device.

Have you ever been curious about what data look like on the back-end?  Do you wonder how business reports are generated? Have you ever noticed that after a search for 'baseball caps' on Amazon your Google adds all seem to be for baseball uniforms?

In this class we will be talking about data modeling and SQL queries.  We will meet for about five hours on a Saturday -- two two-hour instruction blocks with a one-hour break in between.
